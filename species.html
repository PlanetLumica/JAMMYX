                    Jammyx are intelligent, sentient lifeforms made from fungi and liquids that work in symbiosis with different creatures and plants. Aggressive ones invade water bodies while peaceful ones live with other sentient beings, such as humans. They can be made of any semi-liquid substance, as long as it fully covers the Jammyx and their symbiont.

                    Jammyx consume food by submerging it in their cytoplasm and giving the submerged piece to its symbiont. Symbionts can also be referred to as "critters" or "mascots" and are almost always mistaken for the actual Jammyx. The Jammyx itself is really tiny and looks like a small seed or ball swimming somewhere in their cytoplasm, mostly in its "head".

                    Jammyx are incrediby aggressive towards other fungus species and do not participate in symbiosis with fungi and mushrooms. However, there are some exceptions, for example - symbionts can eat mushrooms as a part of its food ration.

                    If their symbiont somehow dies and starts molding, Jammyx quickly discards it and searches for a new one.

                    Jammyx are considered to be space pirates due to big amount of interspace crimes committed by the species. They have a status of yakuza on many planets they invade. Jammyx are very smart and use cybernetics in their lifes as something usual and simple, so you can see them almost always using robotics and hologramic technology. There are many jammyx that are almost fully made of robotics, and they're frequently used as weapons or workers. Jammyx wear clothes and tend to focus on showing off their symbiont because it looks cool. Due to social status, Jammyx usually wear vulgar or, opposingly, really overdetailed and modest outfits. It mostly depends on personality and occupation of a character.

                    Because of simplicity of species, on their masterlist reference, you can include versions with or without clothes! Please note: Jammyx reproduce asexually and therefore, do <strong>not</strong> have those organs!! They may be mimiced in structure but not in extra detail.
